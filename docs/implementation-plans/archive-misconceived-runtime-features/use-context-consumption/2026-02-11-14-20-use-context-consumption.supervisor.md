## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-use-context-consumption.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] `useContext()` function parsing implemented
- [ ] Reactive context consumption transformation working
- [ ] Context value subscriptions handled
- [ ] Context dependency tracking implemented
- [ ] Context value caching supported
- [ ] Re-render minimization optimized
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] Performance optimization scenarios tested

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-use-context-consumption.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user
