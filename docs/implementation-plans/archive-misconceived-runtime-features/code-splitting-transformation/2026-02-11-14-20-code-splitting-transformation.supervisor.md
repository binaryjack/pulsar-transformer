# Code Splitting Transformation Supervisor Plan

## Short Description

Supervisor validation for automatic code splitting transformation implementation to ensure quality and completeness.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\pulsar-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-code-splitting-transformation.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] Component dependency graph analysis implemented
- [ ] Optimal code splitting points transformation working
- [ ] Chunk boundaries and dependencies handled
- [ ] Split point optimization implemented
- [ ] Manual and automatic splitting supported
- [ ] Bundle size and loading performance optimized
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] Bundle optimization scenarios tested

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-code-splitting-transformation.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user
