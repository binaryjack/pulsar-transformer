# Complex JSX Expressions Supervisor Plan

## Short Description

Supervisor validation for complex JSX expressions transformation implementation to ensure quality and completeness.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\pulsar-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-complex-jsx-expressions.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] Complex JSX expression parsing implemented
- [ ] Conditional rendering (`? :`) transformation working
- [ ] Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) handled correctly
- [ ] Nested expression hierarchies supported
- [ ] Reactivity maintained for all dependencies
- [ ] Expression evaluation optimized
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] Performance optimization verified

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-complex-jsx-expressions.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user
